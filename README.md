# 1.	Project topic AND description: 
The topic for my capstone consists of a mobile application provided to Waggy, a fictious company which offers various services for dog owners. The mobile application will provide company staff with information regarding the client’s pet, type of service requested, optional notes, service date and time, search capabilities, and alarms associated with when service is due. In addition, the application will require the user to sign in to ensure data integrity and security.

# 2.	Project purpose/goals:
Waggy provides customers with several services related to assisting with care of their dogs. Currently, Waggy utilizes a website where customers can schedule requested services. Employees then receive an e-mail or text message with their next service assignment. To improve the company’s work flow, Waggy is seeking a mobile application that can provide employees with all of the necessary information to schedule and execute their work activities. Until now, all information about each customer has been saved, tracked, and scheduled in an Excel spreadsheet. By utilizing this mobile application, all employees will have the ability to view, add, edit, and delete any upcoming dog services, create optional notes about each pet, search for customers and reach out directly to clients by having their information quickly available. Consequently, this will improve customer relations by empowering employees with information needed to stay on schedule and perform their expected duties. The migration to utilizing mobile technology is a change that Waggy company has shown interest in for quite some time as they believe it will allow them to scale as the company grows. The main goal is to allow each Waggy employee to work more independently and improve customer service by connecting employees directly with clients.
